# Making a neural network using just numpy

This allowed me to learn how back propagation works

##Overview

This neural network learns from truth table of Full Adder and then on giving a value not in dataset it predicts the output based on the weights it learned while training.

##Dependencies

None! Just numpy (for matrix operations) and pandas (for reading the dataset).

##Usage

Run ``python neuralnetwork.py`` in terminal to see it train and then predict.


##Credits
